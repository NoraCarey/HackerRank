# Manhattan Distance: The distance between two points measured along axes at right angles. 
#                     In a plane with p1 at (x1, y1) and p2 at (x2, y2), it is |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|.

# Euclidean Distance: The straight line distance between two points. 
#                     In a plane with p1 at (x1, y1) and p2 at (x2, y2), it is √((x1 - x2)² + (y1 - y2)²).

# Hamming Distance: The number of bits which differ between two binary strings. 
#                   More formally, the distance between two strings A and B is ∑ | Ai - Bi |.
